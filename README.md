# Conway's Game Of Life

This project is made with Python. there are 3 different versions but the first 2 are just to try out the concept. The third one is the final version and you can play it without editing the array inside the code.
To play it you select a couple of boxes and press space to run the program. Now you can see all the different generations of the chosen pattern.
